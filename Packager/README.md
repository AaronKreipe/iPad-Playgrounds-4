Add sources to Swift Playground on iPad

I wish this was a little easier to use, but it's kind of a hack.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Write the code you want to include in any swift playground.
  Make sure to debug thoroughly, as there is no access once compiled into sources folder.
2. Open Packager.playground and edit line 10
3. Add source files using [+] button in upper right corner
4. Input names for your sources.  
  These are the names they will use in the new playground, and can be different than the source file name.  
  Don’t include the “.swift” part.
5. Input the name for your new playground
6. Run the playground - a popover will appear where you can chose to “save to Files”.
  Make sure to put the new playground in your playground folder on iCloud.
7. Go back to the “My Playgrounds” screen and pick your new playground 
8. enjoy, and share!
